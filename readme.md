# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

It fetches data from the web and displays it in a scrolling list that's easy and interactive for users to view.

### Notes
1. I will surely submit earlier for future assignments;
2. In making this simple movie browsing app, I've encountered "Thread: fatal
error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value" a couple of
times and at moments it was super annoying. I ended up fixing this error by
repeating "cleaning build folder -> build -> run -> restart xcode" several
times.
